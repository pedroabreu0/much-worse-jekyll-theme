I am currently a PhD student at Purdue University. I work with Programming Languages,
Proofs and Theorem Provers. More specifically on synthesis using [Freer Monads](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf).

My advisor is [Benjamin Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/).

Before starting my PhD I was in intern at [Sifive](https://www.sifive.com/) under 
[Murali Vijayaraghavan](http://people.csail.mit.edu/vmurali/). Worked on the formalization
of the floating point unit using [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
and [Kami](http://plv.csail.mit.edu/kami/).

I got my BS in Computer Science at the University of Brasilia, under 
[Rodrigo Bonifacio](http://wp.rbonifacio.net/) in 2017.
