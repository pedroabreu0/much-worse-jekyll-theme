I am currently yellow belt green tag (3rd graduation) in Taekwondo.

My favorite RPG of all times is Lufia: Rise of the Sinistrals.
The second favorite is Chrono Trigger, which I have completed all 13 endings (didn't do the
DS only one yet).
Then Silver. Then the Pokemon series. I have completed the Pokedex of Pokemon
Emerald, so I have a Cyndaquill there. Yes, I am very proud if this, it took me years!

I have a level 66 Plainswalker in Lineage II Classic and plenty of great friends there,
not sure how things will go now that I'm starting the PhD.

My favorite food is Deep Fried Cassava (aka Mandioca Frita). 
Beginer whisky apreciator (free gift tip right there).
No need to mention I'm a coffee lover. 

Cryptocurrency is the future of money, fiat stinks like a dead body, its a matter
of time. That's why most of my money is in Decred. Would probably be safer
to leave it on Bitcoin, but unfortunally I don't se how can Bitcoin be the future.

Even though I have traveled quite a lot for a regular Brazilian in my age,
I am not a big fan of turisting.

I love being with my friends and talk about anything that makes their eye sparkle.
I also love meeting new people and making new friends. Please feel free to ping me
in any social media and talk randomly about anything.

I am a [Spiritist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritism).
