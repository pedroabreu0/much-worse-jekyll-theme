I am currently blue belt (6th graduation) in Taekwondo.

My favorite RPG of all times is [Lufia: Rise of the Sinistrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufia_II:_Rise_of_the_Sinistrals).
The second favorite is [Chrono Trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger), 
which I have completed all 13 endings (didn't do the DS only one yet).
Then Silver. Then the Pokemon series. I have completed the Pokedex of Pokemon
Emerald, so I have a Cyndaquill there. 

My favorite food is Deep Fried Cassava (aka Mandioca Frita). 
Beginer whisky apreciator (free gift tip right there).
I'm learning how to cook, if you want to see some of my dishes feel free to
check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p_droabreu/).
I'm also a coffee lover. 

I love being with my friends and talk about anything that makes their eye sparkle.
I also love meeting new people and making new friends.

I follow a religion called [Spiritism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritism),
it's quite popular in Brazil, but I still haven't met a non-Brazilian that has
heard about it.
